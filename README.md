"This project analyzes bikeshare data for three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, the program allows users to explore data by filtering based on city, month, and day of the week. It provides insights such as the most common travel times, popular stations, and trip durations. The dataset includes information on user types, and for some cities, gender and birth year details. This project demonstrates data manipulation using pandas and offers an interactive way to analyze bikeshare trends."

Bike Share Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project explores bikeshare data for three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, the program allows users to filter data by city, month, and day of the week to analyze trends in bikeshare usage. The script provides insights such as the most popular travel times, frequently used stations, and trip durations.

Dataset
The project uses bikeshare data stored in .csv files (not included in this repository). The datasets contain the following key columns:

Start Time: The timestamp when the trip started.
End Time: The timestamp when the trip ended.
Trip Duration: Total trip time in seconds.
Start Station & End Station: The stations where trips began and ended.
User Type: Subscriber or Customer.
Gender & Birth Year: Available for Chicago and New York City only.
